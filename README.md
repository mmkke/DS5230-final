DS5230 Final Project Clustering


### Goal and Description
The goal of this project is to develop an appreciation of the challenges and pitfalls of clustering.
Clustering, like most other machine learning algorithms, will dutifully return an answer without regard for its usefulness or meaningfulness.
This feature of machine learning algorithms is especially problematic in unsupervised learning due to the lack of a target attribute to supervise the training and evaluate the resulting model.
